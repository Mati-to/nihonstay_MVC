# NihonStay
NihonStay is a web application that allows its users to search for vacation homes in Japan, or post a house to rent. This 
application is developed in PHP, SASS, Javascript, Gulp and MySQL.
I started this project using a "Spaguetti" design, and through the process of making the website, I've learned 
about OOP and now I'm finishing it applying the MVC architecture. 
With the size of this project, I feel more comfortable using MVC and I feel happy to learn more about about different 
architectures to create a web application.

## Features
- Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD): users can create and publish a house for rent, read information about available 
vacation homes, update information about a house already published or delete a previously published house.
